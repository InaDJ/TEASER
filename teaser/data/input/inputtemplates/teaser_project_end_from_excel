    We need to set the projects calculation method. To export the ready-to-run models:
     simply call Project.export_ibpsa(). First specify the IBPSA related library you
     want to export the models for. The models are identical in each library, but IBPSA
     Modelica library is  just a core set of models and should not be used standalone.
     Valid values are 'AixLib' (default), 'Buildings','BuildingSystems' and 'IDEAS'.
     You can specify the path, where the model files should be saved. None means that
     the default path in your home directory will be used. If you only want to export
     one specific building, you can pass over the internal_id of that building and only
     this model will be exported. In this case we want to export all buildings to our
     home directory, thus we are passing over None for both parameters. We also save
     the entire project in teaserXML format.
